## Overview

**Color Ascent** is a platformer shooter game where the goal of the player is to achieve as high a score as possible. The game follows the standards of the classic genre, with a layout and goal similar to Donkey Kong, where the goal of the player is to reach the top platform an continue on the next level. It also includes rogue-like elements with the ability to pick up items and improve the player's stats, which was inspired by the game Risk of Rain.

## Gameplay

The player controls a human figure equiped with a gun that shoots colored balls. With each bounce the ball changes color, and after a number of these bounces it disappears. The goal of the player is to climb up through gaps in the ceiling and reach the highest point of the level where a door is located that will take the player to the next level. Along the way on each row the player will encounter two types of enemies which will shoot harmful projectiles. Each hit that the player recieves will reduce the health of the player, and if the health reaches zero, the game ends.
